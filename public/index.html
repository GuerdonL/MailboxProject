					<p>An abortion can be life-saving healthcare for those in unstable, unsafe, and/or abusive living situations.</p><p>However, taking the time off of work to access a procedure in-person isn't feasible for many, and having pills for a medication abortion delivered directly to a home address can be dangerous if someone is living in an unsupportive environment.</p><p>That's why General Mailing Addresses (GMAs) can be incredibly helpful resources to ensure that those in need can access medication. GMAs are temporary mailing addresses where recipients can pick up their mail with proper verification for up to 30 days after delivery. </p><p>The Mailbox Project was designed to help those in unsafe situations access the reproductive care they need by inputting their address and finding the nearest GMAs. No matter who you are, or where you live, we want to ensure that you maintain the right to choose what happens to your body.</p>
